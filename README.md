# First Repository: Shlesha Van
It's an amazing experience to participate in Google-Code-in. At first I was overwhelmed over the unusal words I was surronded by "repositories", "forks" etc. But then, I decided to keep patience and work with diligence; I reaped amazing fruits, instead of feeling discoraged I feel much more confident to do a ICT-based task.
